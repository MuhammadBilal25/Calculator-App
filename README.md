# Calculator-App
Flutter Calculator App:
A simple and elegant calculator application built using Flutter. This app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with a responsive and interactive UI, following a standard calculator layout.

ðŸ“± Features:
ðŸ§  Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
ðŸ”¢ Supports decimal inputs and percentage calculation
ðŸŽ¨ Clean and minimal user interface
ðŸš€ Fast and responsive performance
ðŸ§© Uses math_expressions package for expression parsing and evaluation

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Flutter: Frontend framework for building the UI
Dart: Programming language used with Flutter
math_expressions: For parsing and evaluating math expressions

ðŸ§© Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ Components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my_button.dart       # Custom reusable button widget
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                # Entry point
â””â”€â”€ HomeScreen.dart          # Calculator UI and logic

ðŸ’¡ How It Works
The calculator interface is built using a column of rows of custom MyButton widgets.
User input is collected in a string, and pressing = triggers parsing via the math_expressions library.
Operators like x are internally converted to * before evaluation.
The result is shown dynamically below the input field.
